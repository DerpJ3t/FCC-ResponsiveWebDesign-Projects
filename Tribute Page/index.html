                <p class="intro-content">Richard Paul Astley (born 6<sup>th</sup> February 1966) is a British singer, songwriter and radio personality. </p>
                <p class="intro-content">Astley made a comeback in 2007, becoming an Internet phenomenon when the music video for <strong>"Never Gonna Give You Up"</strong> became integral to the Rickrolling meme.[6] Astley was voted "Best Act Ever" by Internet users at the MTV Europe Music Awards 2008,[7] and his 2016 album 50 debuted in the UK at No. 1.[8]</p>

                <summary>What is Rick Roll?</summary>
                <p id="tribute-info">Rickrolling, alternatively Rick-rolling or Rickroll, is a prank and an Internet meme involving an unexpected appearance of the music video for the 1987 song "Never Gonna Give You Up," performed by the British singer Rick Astley. The meme is a type of bait and switch using a disguised hyperlink that leads to the music video. When victims click on a seemingly unrelated link, the site with the music video loads instead of what was expected, and in doing so they are said to have been "Rickrolled". The meme has also extended to using the song's lyrics in unexpected places.</p>

                <summary>Why is Rick Roll so popular?</summary>
                <p id="tribute-info">The meme grew out of a similar bait-and-switch trick called "duckrolling" that was popular on the 4chan website in 2006. The video bait-and-switch trick grew popular on 4chan by the 2007 April Fools' Day, and spread to other Internet sites later that year. The meme gained mainstream attention in 2008 through several publicized events, particularly when YouTube used it on its 2008 April Fools' Day event.</p>
